## State Management
This project uses MobX for state management. MobX is a simple and scalable state management solution that allows you to write reactive, observable code. With MobX, you can easily create and manage state, and ensure that your UI always reflects the current state of your app.

## Local Storage Database
This project uses Hive for local storage database. Hive is a lightweight and fast key-value database that is designed to work seamlessly with Flutter. With Hive, you can easily store and retrieve data from your app, without having to worry about complex SQL queries or other database management tasks.
